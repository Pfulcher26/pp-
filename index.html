    <p class="body text">From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second graders in the humid climes 
    of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or 
    the southern skies of his homestate North Carolina, Payne Fulcher truly has seen, 
    and tasted a little of it all.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="body text">But, hey, now seriously y'all, there is a man behind the mask.</p> 
    <p></p>
    </h1></strong>The Man Behind the Mask</strong></h1>
    <p></p>
    <p class="body text">As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow 
    me to take some time to explain a little about myself.</p>

    <p class="body text">That's an image of me with <a href="www.pdxccc.com">The Cascadia Courier Collective</a>, 
    a local, barely-for-profit,bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  
    As you can tell, I'm wearing a mask.  Through the experiences I have accrued in my thus far, 
    I have put on many masks, not in a disengenuous way.  The masks have changed over time, and 
    so has the person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  To get to the point, my younger 
    years mademe a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and that's the programmer 
    you'll get.</p>

    <h2><strong>Why Programming?</strong></h2>

    <p class="body text">In conclusion, I want to take a moment to think about the heart kid from Captain Planet. 
    Yes, I don't even know the heart kid's name. 
    
    Years ago, when I was arguging with someone on the street in Brooklyn 
    (and this really was YEARS AGO), someone from a passing group advised me to be "a refreshing human being", and 
    that idea, as stupid as I regarded it at the time, has always stuck with me.</p>
