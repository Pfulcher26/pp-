    <h>Payne Fulcher: Programmer with a <3</h>
    <p></p>
    <p>From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second gradershumid climes 
    of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or 
    the southern skies of his homestate North Carolina, Payne Fulcher truly has seen, 
    and tasted a little of it all.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But, hey, now seriously y'all, there is a man behind the mask.</p> 
    <p></p>
    </h1>The Man Behind the Mask</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow 
    me to take some time to explain a little about myself.</p>

    <p>That's an image of me with The Cascadia Courier Collective, a local, barely-for-profit,
    bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  As you can tell, I'm wearing
    a mask.  In my life thus far, and the experiences I have accrued, I feel I have put on many
    masks, though not in a disengenuous way.  The masks have changed over time, and so has the 
    person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  To get to the point, my younger years made
    me a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and that's the programmer you'll get.</p>
