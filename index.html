  <h class="headerstyle">The Man Behind the Mask</h>

  <p class="bodystyle">As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow 
  me to take some time to explain a little about myself.</p>

  <p class="bodystyle">That's an image of me with <a href="https://www.pdxccc.com/">The Cascadia Courier Collective</a>, a local, barely-for-profit, bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  
  As you can tell, I'm wearing a mask.  Through the experiences accrued in my life thus far, 
  I've put on many masks.  From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second graders in the humid climes 
  of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or the southern skies of my homestate North Carolina, 
  I've seen, and tasted a little of it all.The masks have changed over time, and so has the person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  My younger 
  years made me a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and <em>that's</em>
  the programmer you'll get.</p>

  <h class="headerstyle">Why Programming?</h>
  <p></p>
  <p class="bodystyle">There is a short sonnet by Japan's most famous Haiku poet Basho that goes "Even in Kyoto
  / Hearing the Cuckoo's Cry/ I long for Kyoto".  Throughout my life I have longed, like 
  Basho, for the ephemeral Kyoto.  That sense of seeking after that which can never truly be fulfilled has driven me over the years, and served as the foundation beneath many of my 
  greatest struggles, and accomplishments in life.  As a programmer, one strives towards the next plateau, 
  never content to stable in place.  The harmonization of humanities, and tech is one of my greatest 
  interests in pursuing code development.  In Japan I spent a great deal of time responsibly implimenting technology
  into the educational environment.  In my future tech career this intersection of tech, and humanities-based 
  learning will be my focus.  I often bike by a mall called the Lloyd Center in Portland.  It's a dulled, dying institution, outwardly
  depressing, but there is something of the ephermeral in it.  By learning to see into the quintessence of things, we can draw 
  out the exceptional from the mundane.  To seek out the spirit of the thing.  In this 
  way, coding should be like writing Haiku.  There should be rhythms, and resonances.  In all things there is

  <h class="headerstyle">'The Kid's Got Heart'</h>
  <p></p>
  <p class="bodystyle">In conclusion, I want to take a moment to think about the heart kid from Captain Planet.  Ma-Ti, as is commonly agreed upon, always seemed like the lamest planeteer.  He couldn't
  really <em>do</em> anything.  While everyone else was out moving lava, creating tornados,    
  splitting the earth in two, Ma-Ti was <em>making friends with monkeys</em>.  But from the current perspective,
  as one grows up, enters into, and becomes part of the world, we see
  that Ma-Ti, as hackneyed as it sounds, is actually the most essential of all the planeteers, because he possesses what is uniquely ours as humans, the only element we can control:
  <strong>heart</strong>.  As programmers, we are much the same.  Though we manipulate extremely
  powerful tools capable of altering, and in some cases superceding reality, our truest power 
  lies in how we care for the world, and our place in it.  We strive to possess the power of 
  Ma-Ti.  We therefore strive to be, now and always, refreshing human-beings.</p>
