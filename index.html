    <h><strong>Payne Fulcher: PROGRAMMER WITH</strong></h>

    <p class="bodystyle">From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second graders in the humid climes 
    of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or 
    the southern skies of his homestate North Carolina, Payne Fulcher truly has seen, 
    and tasted a little of it all.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">But, hey, now seriously y'all, there is a man behind the mask.</p> 
    <p></p>
    </h></strong>The Man Behind the Mask</strong></h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow 
    me to take some time to explain a little about myself.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">That's an image of me with <a href="www.pdxccc.com">The Cascadia Courier Collective</a>, 
    a local, barely-for-profit,bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  
    As you can tell, I'm wearing a mask.  Through the experiences I have accrued in my thus far, 
    I have put on many masks, not in a disengenuous way.  The masks have changed over time, and 
    so has the person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  To get to the point, my younger 
    years mademe a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and that's the programmer 
    you'll get.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h><strong>Why Programming?</strong></h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">In conclusion, I want to take a moment to think about the heart kid from Captain Planet. 
    Yes, I don't even know the heart kid's name.  Okay, I just googled it, praise be.  It's Ma-Ti.  
    So, Ma-Ti, as is commonly conferred upon, always seemed like the lamest planeteer.  He couldn't
    really do <em>anything</em>.  While everyone else was out moving lava, creating tornados, 
    splitting the earth into, Ma-Ti was out making friends with monkeys.  But from the current perspective,
    as one grows up, and enters into, becomes part of the world, and views it on its own terms, we see
    that Ma-Ti, as hackneyed as it sounds, was actually the most essential of all the planeteers, because
    he had possessed the power of the only element within the world that we as humans can control:
    <strong>the heart</strong>.  As programmers, we are much the same.  Though we manipulate extremely
    powerful tools now capable of altering, and in some cases superceding reality, our truest power 
    lies in how we care for the world, and our place in it.  We must strive to possess the power of 
    Ma-Ti.  We must strive to be refreshing human-beings.</p>
