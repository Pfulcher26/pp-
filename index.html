    <p class="bodystyle">From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second graders in the humid climes 
    of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or 
    the southern skies of his homestate North Carolina, Payne Fulcher truly has seen, 
    and tasted a little of it all.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">But hey now, seriously y'all, there is a man behind the mask.</p> 
    <p></p>
    <h class="headerstyle">The Man Behind the Mask</h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow 
    me to take some time to explain a little about myself.</p>

    <p class="bodystyle">That's an image of me with <a href="www.pdxccc.com">The Cascadia Courier Collective</a>, 
    a local, barely-for-profit,bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  
    As you can tell, I'm wearing a mask.  Through the experiences accrued in my life thus far, 
    I've put on many masks.  The masks have changed over time, and 
    so has the person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  To get to the point, my younger 
    years made me a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and <strong>that's</strong>
    the programmer you'll get.</p>

    <h class="headerstyle">Why Programming?</h>
    <p class="bodystyle">There is a short sonnet by Japan's most famous Haiku poet Basho that goes, "Even in Kyoto
    / Hearing the Cuckoo's Cry/ I long for Kyoto".  Throughout my life I have longed, like 
    Basho for the ephemeral Kyoto.

    <h class="headerstyle">'The Kid's Got Heart'</h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">In conclusion, I want to take a moment to think about the heart kid from Captain Planet. 
    Yes, I don't even know the heart kid's name.  Okay, I just googled it, praise be.  It's Ma-Ti.  
    So, Ma-Ti, as is commonly conferred upon, always seemed like the lamest planeteer.  He couldn't
    really do <em>anything</em>.  While everyone else was out moving lava, creating tornados, 
    splitting the earth in two, Ma-Ti was out <em>making friends with monkeys</em>.  But from the current perspective,
    as one grows up, and enters into, becomes part of the world, and views it on its own terms, we see
    that Ma-Ti, as hackneyed as it sounds, was actually the most essential of all the planeteers, because
    he had possessed the power of the only element within the world that we as humans can control:
    <strong>the heart</strong>.  As programmers, we are much the same.  Though we manipulate extremely
    powerful tools now capable of altering, and in some cases superceding reality, our truest power 
    lies in how we care for the world, and our place in it.  We must strive to possess the power of 
    Ma-Ti.  We must strive to be, now and always, refreshing human-beings.</p>
