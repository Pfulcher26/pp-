    <p class="bodystyle">As my father always said, behind every mask there is a man.  Therefore, allow

    <p class="bodystyle">That's an image of me with <a href="www.pdxccc.com">The Cascadia Courier Collective</a>, 
    a local, barely-for-profit,bike delivery service in Portland, OR, aka <em>my crew</em>.  
    As you can tell, I'm wearing a mask.  Through the experiences accrued in my life thus far, 
    I've put on many masks.  From teaching English to an adoring cadre of second graders in the humid climes 
    of southern Japan, the humble offices of Teen Mom 2 in New York City, or the southern skies of my homestate North Carolina, 
    I've seen, and tasted a little of it all.The masks have changed over time, and so has the person beneath in some small, immeasurable ways.  My younger 
    years made me a more well-rounded, generous, and diverse person, and <em>that's</em>
    the programmer you'll get.</p>

    <h class="headerstyle">Why Programming?</h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">There is a short sonnet by Japan's most famous Haiku poet Basho that goes, to paraphrase, "Even in Kyoto
    / Hearing the Cuckoo's Cry/ I long for Kyoto".  Throughout my life I have longed, like 
    Basho for the ephemeral Kyoto.  That sense of seekig after that which can never truly be fulfilled has driven me over the years, and been the foundation beneath many of my 
    greatest struggles, and accomplishments in life.  As a programmer, one strives towards the next plateau, 
    never content stable in place.  The harmonization of humanities, and tech is one of my greatest 
    interests in pursuing code development.  In Japan I spent a great deal of time responsibly implimenting technology
    into the educational environment.  In my future tech career this intersection of tech, and humanities based 
    learning will be my focus.  Moreover, I hope to continue to integrate my former experiences in the humanities
    into my coding career pathway.  I often bike by a mall called the Lloyd Center in Portland.  It's a a dying institution, outwardly
    depressing, but there is something of the ephermeral in it.  By learning to see into the quintessence of things, we can draw 
    out the exceptional from the mundane.  This is also my mission in teach, as in life.  To seek out the spirit of the thing.  In this 
    way, coding should be like writing Haiku.  There should be rhythms, and resonances.

    <h class="headerstyle">'The Kid's Got Heart'</h>
    <p></p>
    <p class="bodystyle">In conclusion, I want to take a moment to think about the heart kid from Captain Planet. 
    Yes, I don't even know the heart kid's name.  Okay, I just googled it, praise be.  It's Ma-Ti.  
    So, Ma-Ti, as is commonly conferred upon, always seemed like the lamest planeteer.  He couldn't
    really do <em>anything</em>.  While everyone else was out moving lava, creating tornados, 
    splitting the earth in two, Ma-Ti was out <em>making friends with monkeys</em>.  But from the current perspective,
    as one grows up, and enters into, becomes part of the world, and views it on its own terms, we see
    that Ma-Ti, as hackneyed as it sounds, was actually the most essential of all the planeteers, because
    he had possessed the power of the only element within the world that we as humans can control:
    <strong>the heart</strong>.  As programmers, we are much the same.  Though we manipulate extremely
    powerful tools now capable of altering, and in some cases superceding reality, our truest power 
    lies in how we care for the world, and our place in it.  We must strive to possess the power of 
    Ma-Ti.  We must strive to be, now and always, refreshing human-beings.</p>
